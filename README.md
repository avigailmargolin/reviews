## Getting Started

From within the root directory:

```
npm install
```

To run on a local machine, start mySQL service and in database/index.js on line 3 and line 10 update root user and password that matches your local machine mySQL.

For mySQL EC2 instance, a new credential and user name may need to be created with all admin rights for set up and database seeding to work properly. Need to update client/src/main.jsx axios get request path on line 35 to EC2 instance IP address.

To seed the database

```
node database/index.js
npm run seed-db
```

To start webpack

```
npm run react-dev
```

Start the server (on port 3002)

```
npm start
```

## Testing

npm run test
```
